# Google-Drive-Direct-Link-Generator

Use the Javascript file to fetch all the links of the files required via FileScipt.js


Else, you can select the items required>right click>share>Get shareable links>Paste to spreadsheet and run Google Drive Direct Link.py


You can use this python file to create a link which can be used to access google drive shared files for Web Hosting or App Video Hosting and so on.


So, you would be hosting the file on Google Drive, but it will be available like a playable content for Web Pages. Just like YouTube.


The approach for creating the accessible links have been taken from this [website](https://www.wonderplugin.com/online-tools/google-drive-direct-link-generator/).
